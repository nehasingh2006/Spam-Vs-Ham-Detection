# Spam-Vs-Ham-Detection
## Predicting mail is Spam or Ham using Naive Bayes Algorithm

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem, with an assumption that all the features that are used in predicting the target class 
are independent of each other.
The goal of this model is to predict weather the given mail is spam or not using Naïve bayes classifier. Firstly, we will be constructing a model from
given Spam Ham mail training data sets. Then we will create filter based on feature of words found in spam or ham mail.
